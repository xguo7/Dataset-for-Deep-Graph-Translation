# Dataset-for-Deep-Graph-Translation
This page summarize and provide the data and applications for the deep graph translation problem. The deep graph translation problem aims to learn the mapping rules among graphs atomatically by oberving large amount of graph pairs based on the deep learning methods, as shown in the Figure 1. There are two versions of deep graph translation problems: one is to learn a one-to-one mapping rule between the input graph and target graph, as the defination by Guo et al [1]; another is to learn a one-to-many mapping rule between the input graph and a set of target graphs, which is defined by Guo et al [2]; To avoid loss of generality, the graph in this problems can be all kinds of graphs, such as directed/undirected graphs, sign graphs, and multi-attributed graph. 

For wider investigation and explaration by researchers around the world, we provide five synthetic or real-world data as well as their application tasks for this problem: Scale-free graphs dataset, IoT (Internet of Things) dataset, Brainnetwork connectivety dataset, User authenticfication dataset, and the chemistry reaction dataset.
